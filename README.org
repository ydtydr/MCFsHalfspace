*** Introduction
This repo contains official code and models for the paper: Representing Hyperbolic Space Accurately using Multi-Component Floats.

** Installation
Clone this repository and run following commands
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/ydtydr/HyperbolicTiling_Learning.git
  cd HyperbolicTiling_Learning
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  source activate tiling
  python setup.py build_ext --inplace
#+END_SRC

** Dependencies
- Python 3 with NumPy
- PyTorch
- Scikit-Learn
- NLTK (to generate the WordNet data)

** Example: Embedding WordNet Mammals
First generate the transitive closure of data via
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd wordnet
  python transitive_closure.py
#+END_SRC
This will generate the transitive closure of the full noun, verb hierarchy as well as of the mammals subtree of WordNet.
We also include the Gr-QC dataset in /wordnet/ folder.

To embed the mammals subtree in the reconstruction setting, go to the /root directory/ of
the project and run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./train.sh
#+END_SRC
This shell script includes the appropriate parameter settings. Available models: =Halfspace=, =MCsHalfspace=, =xMCsHalfspace=, =Poincare=, =Lorentz=, =NLorentz=, =LTiling_rsgd=, =NLTiling_rsgd=, =LTiling_sgd= and =HTiling_rsgd=.
